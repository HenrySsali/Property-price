 # üè†Property-price
 __This read me file indicates a breakdown process of obtaining the price of a property(houses) in england.__
 
 __House price prediction is a problem in the real estate industry to make informed decisions. By using machine learning algorithms we can predict the price of a house based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms and other relevant factors.  we will explore how to build a machine learning model in Python to predict house prices to gain valuable insights into the housing market.__
 
__To tackle this issue we will build a machine learning model trained on the House Price Prediction Dataset. We can download the dataset from the provided link. It includes 13 features:__

 __I have used google colab as it more efficient and effective ,for its's inbuilt AI features.__
 
 __I have broken down the whole process in to steps, from step 1 to step 7.And the steps are all well explained for an easy follow up.Below are the steps.__

 # Step 1:
 * I started by importing the necessary libraries required to manipulate the data.As well as importing the dataset.
 * In the above step we go ahead to identify the shape of our dataset,to determine the volume of it which is (2919,13).
