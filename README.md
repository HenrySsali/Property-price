 # üè†Property-price
 __This read me file indicates a breakdown process of obtaining the price of a property(houses) in england.__
 
 __House price prediction is a problem in the real estate industry to make informed decisions. By using machine learning algorithms we can predict the price of a house based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms and other relevant factors.  we will explore how to build a machine learning model in Python to predict house prices to gain valuable insights into the housing market.__
 
__To tackle this issue we will build a machine learning model trained on the House Price Prediction Dataset. We can download the dataset from the provided link. It includes 13 features:__

 __I have used google colab as it more efficient and effective ,for its's inbuilt AI features.__
 
 __I have broken down the whole process in to steps, from step 1 to step 7.And the steps are all well explained for an easy follow up.Below are the steps.__

 # Step 1:Importing libraries and Dataset
* I started by importing the necessary libraries required to manipulate the data.As well as    importing the dataset.
* In the above step we go ahead to identify the shape of our dataset,to determine the volume of it which is (2919,13).

# Step 2: Data preprocessing
* Now, we categorize the features depending on their datatype (int, float, object) and then calculate the number of them. As shown here https://github.com/HenrySsali/Property-price/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202025-07-15%20150408.png
# Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
* EDA refers to the deep analysis of data so as to discover different patterns and spot anomalies. Before making inferences from data it is essential to examine all your variables. So here let's make a heatmap using seaborn library.https://github.com/HenrySsali/Property-price/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202025-07-15%20150432.png
* We use the heatmap to show the correction between the categorical data
